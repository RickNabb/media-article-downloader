"Following university protocol, the Office of University Counsel will assist in connecting the student to external legal resources should the individual request our assistance."A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told Fox News that Ozturk was "granted the privilege to be in this country on a visa.""DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans," the spokesperson said. "A visa is a privilege not a right. Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated.
